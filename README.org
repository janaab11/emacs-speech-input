#+TITLE: Emacs Speech Input

Personal set of tools for involving speech while working with Emacs. Once
stable, this place should provide a consistent API involving various kinds of
speech based acts and delegate to various backends.

The API will cover pieces like:
1. Voice activity detection
2. Hot word detection
3. Speaker Verification
4. Regular utterance transcription

For now, I am trying to set up a regular command-and-control stuff based on 4th
method using a kaldi backend.
